Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of deep learning for generating realistic data. In this work, we explore the potential of GANs from an educational and experimental perspective, starting with the generation of points on a straight line and progressing towards approximating a cosine function. Using a GAN network architecture, we demonstrate how these networks can learn the underlying data distribution and generate samples that resemble the distribution of real data. Through training iterations and parameter adjustments, we observe how the GAN network evolves from generating simple patterns to capturing more complex patterns. This study aims to generate new images based on a dataset comprising 1,021 images of jellyfish belonging to six different categories and species: mauve stinger jellyfish, moon jellyfish, barrel jellyfish, blue jellyfish, compass jellyfish, and lion's mane jellyfish.
